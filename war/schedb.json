Extensive research efforts have been expended on understanding how biologic systems interact with biomaterials. Meanwhile, controversy has revolved around biomaterials and their availability as a result of the backlash to the huge liability resulting from controversies related to material and processing shortcomings of medical devices. This course specifically addresses the unique role of biomaterials in medical device design and the use of emerging biomaterials technology in medical devices. The need to understand design requirements of medical devices based on safety and efficacy will be addressed. Unexpected device failure can occur if testing fails to account for synergistic interactions from chronic loading, aqueous environments, and biologic interactions. Testing methodologies are readily available to assess accelerated effects of loading in physiologic-like environments. This combined with subchronic effects of animal implants is a potential tool in assessing durability. It is difficult to predict the chronic effects of the total biologic environment. The ultimate determination of safety comes not only from following the details of regulations, but with an understanding of potential failure modes and designs that lowers the risk of these failures. This course will evaluate biomaterials and their properties as related to the design and reliability of medical devices.","minCredits":3.0,"maxCredits":4.5,"gradeType":"normal","note":"","sections":[{"crn":20870,"number":"191","seats":30,"availableseats":30,"term":"201402","partOfTerm":"C Term, D Term","note":"","periods":[{"type":"Lecture","professor":"STAFF","days":["TUESDAY"],"starts":1830,"ends":2120,"location":"HL218"}]}]},{"number":"532","name":"Medical Device Regulation","description":"This course provides an overview of regulations that guide the medical devices industry.

II This course is a general introduction to the field of development economics. The focus is on ways in which a developing country can increase its productive capacity, both agricultural and industrial, in order to achieve sustained economic growth. The course proceeds by first examining how economic growth and economic development are measured and how the various nations of the world compare according to well-known social and economic indicators. Theories of economic growth and theories of economic development are then examined, as are the various social and cultural structures that are thought to influence economic progress. The inputs to economic growth and development (land, labor, capital, entrepreneurial ability, education, technical change), and the possible distributions of income and levels of employment that result from their use, is considered next. Domestic economic problems and policies such as development planning, the choice of sectorial policies, the choice of monetary and fiscal policies, rapid population growth, and urbanization and urban economic development are then examined. The course concludes with a consideration of international problems and policies such as import substitution and export promotion, foreign debt, foreign investment, and the role of international firms. In conjunction with a traditional presentation of the above topics, the course curriculum will include the use of computer simulation models and games. These materials have been formulated with a simulation technique, system dynamics, that has its origins in control engineering and the theory of servomechanisms. As a result, students will find them complementary to their work in engineering and science. In addition, the various development theories and simulation and gaming results will be related, where possible, to specific developing nations where WPI has on-going project activities (e.g., Costa Rica and Thailand).

II Experimental economics is a set of methods for testing hypotheses about behavior. Traditional economic analysis using naturally occurring data is often confounded by the complexities of the real world. Economic experiments, on the other hand, give researchers the control required for isolating behaviors of interest. As such, economic experiments can be useful tools for testing existing theories and establishing empirical regularities assisting in the development of new theories. In this course, we cover the basic principles of experimental design. We also study a number of classic experiments, on topics ranging from the efficiency of markets to decision-making under uncertainty and behavioral game theory. Students will participate in mock experiments and will begin putting their new skills into practice by designing their own experiments, which may serve as the basis for IQPs/MQPs. If time permits, we will discuss some of the basic methods for analyzing experimental data, which presents challenges somewhat different from naturally occurring data due to small sample sizes.

Topics such as environmental justice, developing nations, globalization, and climate change policy will be explored.","minCredits":2.0,"maxCredits":3.0,"gradeType":"normal","note":"","sections":[{"crn":10491,"number":"B01","seats":50,"availableseats":50,"term":"201401","partOfTerm":"B Term","note":"","periods":[{"type":"Lecture","professor":"STAFF","days":["THURSDAY","MONDAY"],"starts":900,"ends":1050,"location":"SL305"}]},{"crn":20637,"number":"D01","seats":50,"availableseats":50,"term":"201402","partOfTerm":"D Term","note":"","periods":[{"type":"Lecture","professor":"STAFF","days":["FRIDAY","TUESDAY"],"starts":0,"ends":1350,"location":"SL305"}]}]},{"number":"2200","name":"Environm Stu in Various Discpl","description":"","minCredits":3.0,"maxCredits":3.0,"gradeType":"normal","note":"","sections":[{"crn":21226,"number":"C01","seats":50,"availableseats":50,"term":"201402","partOfTerm":"C Term","note":"","periods":[{"type":"Lecture","professor":"STAFF","days":["THURSDAY","MONDAY"],"starts":1100,"ends":50,"location":"SL411"}]}]},{"number":"2400","name":"Environmental Problems and Human Behavior","description":"Cat. II This course examines how people think about and behave toward the environment. Environmental problems can ultimately be attributed to the environmental decisions and actions of human beings. These behaviors can in turn be understood as resulting from the nature and limitations of the human mind and the social context in which behavior takes place. Knowledge of the root causes of environmentally harmful behavior is essential for designing effective solutions to environmental problems. The goals of the course are (1) to provide students with the basic social science knowledge needed to understand and evaluate the behavioral aspects of such important environmental problems as air and water pollution, global warming, ozone depletion, preserving biological diversity, and hazardous waste and (2) to help students identify and improve shortcomings in their knowledge and decisions related to the environment. Topics will include, but not be limited to: environmental problems as ?tragedies of the commons?; public understanding of global warming and global climate modeling; folk biology; risk perception; intelligent criticism of environmental claims; making effective environmental choices; strategies for promoting pro-environmental behavior; and human ability to model and manage the global environmental future. Recommended background: ENV 1100. Suggested background: PSY 1400, PSY 1401, or PSY 1402. Students may not receive credit for both PSY 2405 and ENV 2400.

II Environment and development are often seen as incompatible, in part because many poor people in the developing world depend directly on natural resources for their livelihoods. At the same time, poor people are often seen as responsible for causing environmental degradation because they lack the knowledge, skills and resources to manage the environment effectively. The vicious circle is completed as environmental degradation exacerbates poverty. However, optimists argue that poor people can and do contribute positively to environmental o utcomes, that states and organizations can facilitate their efforts and that environmental interventions can coincide with development. This course will examine these different perspectives on environmental problems in the developing world through the insights and critiques of social science. Subjects covered include sustainable development, population, environmental risks, gender, urbanization, environmental decision making, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). The goals of this course are to think critically about the various links between environment and development and the role of governmental and non-governmental organizations in promoting sustainable development in the developing world.

It also examines the formation of science policy, the politics of science and technology, the science bureaucracy, enduring controversies such as public participation in scientific debates, the most effective means for supporting research, and the regulation of technology. Throughout the course we will pay particular attention to the fundamental theme: the tension between government demands for accountability and the scientific community?s commitment to autonomy and self-regulation.

II Environmental issues present some of the major international problems and opportunities facing the world today. Worst-case scenarios envision irrevocable degradation of the earth?s natural systems, but virtually every analysis sees the need for major change worldwide to cope with problems such as global warming, deforestation, ozone layer depletion, loss of biodiversity, and population growth, not to mention exponential increases in ?conventional? pollutants in newly industrialized countries. The global environment issues represent a ?second-generation? of environmental policy in which the focus of concern has moved from national regulations to international law and institutions. In addition, the environment has emerged as a major aspect of international trade, conditioning corporate investment and accounting for some $200 billion in sales of pollution control equipment in 1991. Exploration of the genesis and implications of these phenomena is the essence of the course. Topically, the material begins with the nature of global environmental problems, drawing on literature from large-scale global modeling as well as particular analyses of the problems mentioned above. Approximately half the course focuses on international laws and institutions, including multilateral treaties (e.g., the Montreal Protocol limiting CFC use, ocean dumping, biodiversity), international institutions (UNEP, the Rio Convention, the OECD) and private initiatives (international standards organizations, ICOLP (Industry Committee for Ozone Layer Protection), etc.) In addition, US policy toward global environmental issues will be compared with that in Japan, Europe and developing countries, from which it differs significantly.

We will examine themes such as scales of governance (from the United Nations to communities), policy networks, the role of NGOs, think tanks and special interests and the role of knowledge in global environmental debates.

Applications include: area, volume, arc length, center of mass, work, force, and exponential growth and decay. Logarithmic and exponential functions are studied in depth. Arithmetic and geometric sequences and series will also be covered. Key historical events in the development of integral calculus are examined. Technology will be used as appropriate to support the material being studied. This course extends for 14 weeks and offers 1/3 unit of credit. It is designed for students who would benefit from additional contact hours and who need to strengthen their mathematical background.

Explicit solutions for dynamic response of a linear single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) system, both damped and undamped, is derived for free-vibration caused by the initial conditions and forced vibration caused by different excitations. Modal analysis is presented to solve for vibration response of both multi-degree-of-freedom (MDOF) systems and continuous systems with distributed parameters. As the basis of modal analysis, the natural frequencies and vibration modes of a linear dynamic system are obtained in advance by solving an associated generalized eigenvalue problem and the orthogonal properties of the vibration modes with respect to the stiffness and mass matrices are strictly proved. Computational methods for vibration analysis are introduced. Applications include but are not limited to cushion design of falling packages, vehicles traveling on a rough surface, multi-story building subjected to seismic and wind loading, and vibration analysis of bridges subjected to traffic loading.

The fundamental techniques apply to arms, mobile robots, active sensor platforms, and all other computercontrolled kinematic linkages. The primary applications include robotic arms and mobile robots and lab projects would involve programming of representative robots. An end of term team project would allow students to program robots to participate in challenges or competitions.

Five major topics are covered: use of subscripts, achieving and testing for robustness, use of numerical data, sensitivity analysis, and optimization/calibration of models. The subscripts discussion provides techniques for dealing with detail complexity by changing model equations but not adding additional feedback structure. Robust models are achieved by using good individual equation formulations and making sure that they work together well though automated behavioral experiments. Data, especially time series data, are fundamental to finding and fixing shortcomings in model formulations. Sensitivity simulations expose the full range of behavior that a model can exhibit. Finally, the biggest section, dealing with optimization and calibration of models develops techniques for both testing models against data and developing policies to achieve specified goals.
