<course number="5200" name="MECHANICAL VIBRATIONS" course_desc="(2 Credits) The course provides fundamentals for vibration analysis of linear discrete and continuous dynamic systems, A vibrating system is first modeled mathematically as an initial value problem (IVP) or a boundary-initial value problem (BIVP) by the Newton-DAlembert method and/or the Lagrange energy approach and then solved for various types of system. Explicit solutions for dynamic response of a linear single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) system, both damped and undamped, is derived for free-vibration caused by the initial conditions and forced vibration caused by different excitations. Modal analysis is presented to solve for vibration response of both multi-degree-of-freedom (MDOF) systems and continuous systems with distributed parameters. As the basis of modal analysis, the natural frequencies and vibration modes of a linear dynamic system are obtained in advance by solving an associated generalized eigenvalue problem and the orthogonal properties of the vibration modes with respect to the stiffness and mass matrices are strictly proved. Computational methods for vibration analysis are introduced. Applications include but are not limited to cushion design of falling packages, vehicles traveling on a rough surface, multi-story building subjected to seismic and wind loading, and vibration analysis of bridges subjected to traffic loading.

<course number="531" name="BIOMATERIALS IN THE DESIGN OF MEDICAL DEVICES" course_desc="Biomaterials are an integral part of medical devices,  implants, controlled drug delivery systems, and  tissue engineered constructs. Extensive research  efforts have been expended on understanding  how biologic systems interact with biomaterials.  Meanwhile, controversy has revolved around  biomaterials and their availability as a result of  the backlash to the huge liability resulting from  controversies related to material and processing  shortcomings of medical devices. This course specifically  addresses the unique role of biomaterials  in medical device design and the use of emerging  biomaterials technology in medical devices. The  need to understand design requirements of medical devices based on safety and efficacy will be  addressed. Unexpected device failure can occur if  testing fails to account for synergistic interactions  from chronic loading, aqueous environments,  and biologic interactions. Testing methodologies  are readily available to assess accelerated effects of  loading in physiologic-like environments. This  combined with subchronic effects of animal implants  is a potential tool in assessing durability. It  is difficult to predict the chronic effects of the total  biologic environment. The ultimate determination  of safety comes not only from following the  details of regulations, but with an understanding  of potential failure modes and designs that lowers  the risk of these failures.

Students will learn modern design techniques, using a hardware  description language (HDL) such as Verilog to design, simulate and implement  logic systems consisting of basic gates, adders, multiplexers, latches, and  counters. The function and operation of programmable logic devices, such as  field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), will be described and discussed in  terms of how an HDL logic design is mapped and implemented. Experiments  involving the design of combinational and sequential circuits will provide  students a hands-on introduction to basic digital electrical engineering concepts  and the skills needed to gain more advanced skills. In the laboratory, students  will construct, troubleshoot, and test the digital circuits that they have developed  using a hardware description language. These custom logic designs will be  implemented using FPGAs and validated using test equipment.  Topics: Number representations, Boolean algebra, design and simplification of combinational circuits, arithmetic circuits, analysis and design of sequential  circuits, and synchronous state machines.

Some  pseudo-random generators are introduced. The  concepts of public and private key cryptography  are developed. As important representatives for secret key schemes, DES and IDEA are described.  The public key schemes RSA and ElGamal, and  systems based on elliptic curves are then developed.  Signature algorithms, hash functions, key  distribution and identification schemes are treated  as advanced topics. Some advanced mathematical  algorithms for attacking cryptographic schemes  are discussed. Application examples will include  a protocol for security in a LAN and a secure smart card system for electronic banking. Special  consideration will be given to schemes which  are relevant for network environments. For all  schemes, implementation aspects and up-to-date  security estimations will be discussed.

<course number="2049" name="EMBEDDED COMPUTING IN ENGINEERING DESIGN" course_desc="Cat. I   Embedded computers are literally everywhere in modern life. On any given day  we interact with and depend on dozens of small computers to make coffee, run  cell phones, take pictures, play music, control elevators, manage the  emissions and antilock brakes in our automobile, control a home security  system, and so on. Using popular everyday devices as case studies, students in  this course are introduced to the unique computing and design challenges posed  by embedded systems. Students will then solve real-world design problems using  small, resource constrained (time/memory/power) computing platforms. The hardware and software structure of modern embedded devices and basic interactions between embedded computers and the physical world will also be  covered in lecture and as part of laboratory experiments. In the laboratory,  emphasis is placed on interfacing embedded processors with common sensors  and devices (e.g. temperature sensors, keypads, LCD display, SPI ports, pulse  width modulated motor controller outputs) while developing the skills needed  to use embedded processors in systems design. This course is also appropriate for  RBE and other engineering and CS students interested in learning about  embedded system theory and design.  Topics: Number/data representations, embedded system design using C,  microprocessor and microcontroller architecture, program development and  debugging tools for a small target processor, hardware/software dependencies,  use of memory mapped peripherals, design of event driven software, time and  resource management, applications case studies.  Lab Exercises: Students will solve commonly encountered embedded  processing problems to implement useful systems. Starting with a requirements  list students will use the knowledge gained during the lectures to implement  solutions to problems which explore topics such as user interfaces and  interfacing with the physical world, logic flow, and timing and time constrained  programming. Exercises will be performed on microcontroller and/or  microprocessor based embedded systems using cross platform development tools appropriate to the target platform.

<course number="2600" name="ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD" course_desc=" Cat. II Environment and development are often seen as incompatible, in part because many poor people in the developing world depend directly on natural resources  for their livelihoods. At the same time, poor people are often seen as responsible  for causing environmental degradation because they lack the knowledge, skills  and resources to manage the environment effectively. The vicious circle is  completed as environmental degradation exacerbates poverty. However,  optimists argue that poor people can and do contribute positively to environmental o utcomes, that states and organizations can facilitate their efforts and  that environmental interventions can coincide with development. This course  will examine these different perspectives on environmental problems in the  developing world through the insights and critiques of social science. Subjects  covered include sustainable development, population, environmental risks, gender, urbanization, environmental decision making, and non-governmental  organizations (NGOs).

<course number="2700" name="SOCIAL MEDIA, SOCIAL MOVEMENTS, AND THE ENVIRONMENT" course_desc="Social media platforms are changing the world of social movements, giving rise to a new generation of social activism. Social media can enable local actors to link with others from across the globe to incite social and environmental change. Social media has enabled people to document and share injustices (e.g., violence; dumping of toxic waste) in places where freedom of the press is limited or non-existent, and it has enabled people across different social groups (race, class, etc.) to engage with one another on issues of shared concern. Social media has also allowed people to share resources (financial, expertise, and organizational) with other social actors across the globe, empowering communities in novel ways. This course introduces students to the phenomena of social and environmental movements, theories on why they succeed and fail, and how social media has changed the landscape of social mobilization. This course will draw on interdisciplinary readings, concepts, and case studies from the social sciences, with emphasis on geography, public policy, sociology, and media studies. Course work will include small group projects, analyses of current social movement cases, and a final project. The final project will consist of interviewing members of a current social movement (potentially using social media), evaluating whether particular social media applications have helped to enable social mobilization, and designing new or revised social media tools to further enhance social mobilization.

We will  examine tradition and modernity in some or all of four cultural regions-South  Asia (India), East Asia (China), Southeast Asia (Vietnam or Thailand), Inner  Asia (Tibet)-and globalization in Japan and/or Hong Kong. We will explore  the cultural traditions of these various regions, paying special attention to  history, religion, society. We will also consider modern developments in these  same regions. The impact of colonialism, nationalism, revolution, industrialization  and urbanization on the lives of Asian peoples will be illustrated through  films and readings.

<course number="3100" name="TEACHING METHODS IN MATHEMATICS AND SCIENCE" course_desc="Cat. II Within the context of contemporary secondary education in mathematics and science (biology, chemistry, physics), ID 3100 introduces and demonstrates  effective teaching methods as they relate to curriculum goals and current  methods of assessment. These methods take into account diverse learning styles  as well as various technological resources. Topics to be covered include: a brief  history of education; curriculum and course guidelines (Massachusetts  Education Reform and regulations 603 CMR 7.00, state curricular frameworks,  national standards); legal issues; developing a course syllabus; and the issue of  breadth versus depth in course planning and delivery. The course also covers  practical questions of organizing, delivering and assessing a course. This course is intended primarily for students interested in completing the Massachusetts  requirements for teacher licensing. This program is aimed primarily at majors in  mathematics, physics, chemistry and biology wishing to be licensed to teach in  middle or high school in one of those disciplines. A portion of the course  requires the observation of master teachers at the Massachusetts Academy of  Mathematics and Science, who will work with all students in the course to assist  them in beginning to acquire the appropriate skills to conduct their own classes  in mathematics or science at the secondary school level.

<course number="3150" name="LIGHT, VISION AND UNDERSTANDING" course_desc="Cat. II By using material from the sciences and the humanities this course examines the ways in which ideas of knowledge and of human nature have been fashioned.  The specific topics include physical theories about light, biological and  psychological theories of visual perception, and artistic theories and practices  concerned with representation. The mixing of material from different academic  disciplines is deliberate, and meant to counter the notion that human pursuits  are naturally arranged in the neat packages found in the modern university. The  course draws upon the physical and social sciences, and the humanities, to  examine how those fields relate to one another, and how they produce knowledge  and self-knowledge. Cultural as well as disciplinary factors are assessed in this  process.  Light, Vision and Understanding is conducted as a seminar. The diverse  collection of reading materials includes a number of primary texts in different fields. In addition, the students keep a journal in which they record the results of numerous individual observations and experiments concerning light and visual  perception. The course can fit into several Sufficiency areas as well as serve as a  starting point for an IQP. There are no specific requirements for this course,  although some knowledge of college-level physics, as well an acquaintance with  the visual arts, is helpful.  This course will be offered in 2016-17, and in alternating years thereafter." min-credits="1" max-credits="1" grade-type="normal"><section crn="15119" number="A01" seats="20" availableseats="17" max_waitlist="0" actual_waitlist="5" term="201601" part-of-term="A Term"><period type="Lecture" professor="Not Assigned" professor_sort_name="Not Assigned" professor_email="N/A" days="mon,tue,thu,fri" starts="9:00AM" ends="9:50AM" building="KH" room="115 15119"></period></section></course>

The goal  of the statistical design and analysis of experiments  is to (1) identify the factors which most affect a  given process or phenomenon; (2) identify the  ways in which these factors affect the process or  phenomenon, both individually and in combination;  (3) accomplish goals 1 and 2 with minimum  cost and maximum efficiency while maintaining  the validity of the results. Topics covered in this  course include the design, implementation and  analysis of completely randomized complete  block, nested, split plot, Latin square and repeated  measures designs. Emphasis will be on the application  of the theory to real data using statistical computer packages.

The course starts with the  introduction of metrics of risk such as volatility,  value-at-risk and expected shortfall and with  the fundamental quantitative techniques used in financial risk evaluation and management. The  next section is devoted to market risk including  volatility modeling, time series, non-normal heavy  tailed phenomena and multivariate notions of  co-dependence such as copulas, correlations and  tail-dependence. The final section concentrates  on credit risk including structural and dynamic  models and default contagion and applies the  mathematical tools to the valuation of default contingent claims including credit default swaps,  structured credit portfolios and collateralized debt obligations.

<course number="5200" name="MECHANICAL VIBRATIONS" course_desc="The course provides fundamentals for vibration an alysis of linear discrete and continuous dynamic systems. A vibrating system is first modeled  mathematically as an initial value problem (IVP)  or a boundary-initial value problem (BIVP) by the  Newton-DâAlembert method and/or the Lagrange  energy approach and then solved for various types  of system. Explicit solutions for dynamic response  of a linear single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) system,  both damped and undamped, is derived for  free-vibration caused by the initial conditions and  forced vibration caused by different excitations.  Modal analysis is presented to solve for vibration  response of both multi-degree-of-freedom  (MDOF) systems and continuous systems with  distributed parameters. As the basis of modal  analysis, the natural frequencies and vibration  modes of a linear dynamic system are obtained  in advance by solving an associated generalized  eigenvalue problem and the orthogonal properties  of the vibration modes with respect to the  stiffness and mass matrices are strictly proved.

In addition,  MME students will be expected to master  the mathematical rigor of these calculus concepts  so that they will be better prepared to develop  their own projects and laboratory assignments. For  example, if an MME student chose to develop a  lab on convergence of sequence, he/she would be  expected to understand the rigorous definition of convergence and how to apply it to gain sufficient  and/or necessary conditions for convergence. The process of developing these first-year calculus  assignments will enable the MME students to  increase their own mathematical understanding of  concepts while learning to handle mathematical  and computer issues which will be encountered by  their own calculus students.

<course number="1401" name="COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY" course_desc="Cat. I This course is concerned with understanding and explaining the mental  processes and strategies underlying human behavior. The ways in which sensory  input is transformed, reduced, elaborated, stored, and recovered will be  examined in order to develop a picture of the human mind as an active processor  of information. Topics will include perception, memory, problem-solving,  judgment and decision making, human-computer interaction, and artificial  intelligence. Special attention will be paid to defining the limitations of the human cognitive system. Students will undertake a project which employs one  of the experimental techniques of cognitive psychology to collect and analyze  data on a topic of their own choosing.

<course number="1504" name="STRATEGIES FOR IMPROVING COGNITIVE SKILLS" course_desc="Cat. I  Life experience provides us with little insight into the basic workings of our own minds. As a result, we tend to approach many of the important problems and  decisions of our professional and personal lives with only a dim awareness of the  limitations and capabilities of the human cognitive system and how its  performance can be improved. The purpose of this course is (1) to provide  students with the basic psychological knowledge needed to understand and  evaluate such important cognitive skills as memory, problem solving, decision  making, and reasoning and (2) to provide students the practical skills and  experience necessary to improve and assess their cognitive performance. Topics will include but not be limited to memory improvement, study skills, effective  problem solving techniques, creativity, numeracy, making effective choices, risky  decision making, dynamic decision making, intelligent criticism of assumptions  and arguments, and evaluating claims about the mind.

Questions explored may include: Does science yield truth? Are the results of scientific inquiry more a reflection of the workings of the human mind than of those of the external world? Do pivotal scientificconcepts like gene, electron, photon, species, and ecosystem point to entities that actually exist? Does the history of science, which includes many refutations of theories once believed to be true, raise questions about whether currently accepted theories should be trusted? By what methods does a scientific community validate knowledge claims and how are these processes affected by social, political, and economic contexts? Does a scientist have a responsibility to conduct morally conscientious research? How does the development of technology affect our spiritual and moral characters? In what ways is science similar to religion and in what ways is it different? The focus of this course may vary each time it is offered from an examination of science in general to an investigation of the foundations of specific branches of science such as physics, biology, environmental science, or social science.

II This course examines medicine, not from a scientific or professional view, but from a specificallyhumanistic approach. Using essays, films, fiction, poetry and plays, we will aim to make explicit the moral values most deeply held by practitioners in the healing professions. What other kinds of values can get in the way of those most deeply held aims? What are the responsibilities of a medical professional in todays society? What are the sources of those responsibilities? The course will focus both on professional and personal dilemmas and will help students think through some moral problems that are likely to confront them in their professional and personal lives. The class should also help prepare students to navigate through the tough moral issues they are likely to face, either as a medical professional, a citizen, a parent, a child of parents, or as potentially a sick person themselves. This class proposes to grant students the reflective time to read some of the most eloquent authors on suffering, caretaking, and sickness (for example, Oliver Sacks, Jerome Groopman, Susan Sontag, Leo Tolstoy, Virginia Woolf, Tony Kushner, Tracy Kidder, Perri Klass, etc.) and to express their reflections on these resources in effective communication.
